## Account Safety

Cypher is designed from the ground up to be a **safe Honkai: Star Rail bot**. It operates by emulating a normal player's actions through mouse clicks and screen captures only.

* **No Memory Reading/Writing:** Does not interact with the game's memory.
* **No Kernel-Level Access:** Runs as a standard user-level application.
* **GDI Window capture:** Uses the most high-level method of image reading which is not detected by anti-cheats.

* Nikke: Goddess of Victory
* Zenless Zone Zero
* Wuthering Waves (in development)
